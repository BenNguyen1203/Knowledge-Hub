### Definition
- Machine learning is turning things into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.
- **"If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that."**

### What deep learning is good for machine learning?
- **Problems with long lists of rules** - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.
- **Continually changing environment** - deep learning can adapt to new scenarios.
- **Discovering insights within large collections of data**

### What deep learning is (typically) not good for machine learning?
- **When you need explainability** - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
- **When the tradition approach is a better option** - if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
- **When errors are unacceptable** - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable.
- **When you don't have much data** - deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results. (though we can achieve great results without hugh amounts of data)
