### Definition
- Machine learning is turning things into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.
- **"If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that."**

### What deep learning is good for machine learning?
- **Problems with long lists of rules** - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.
- **Continually changing environment** - deep learning can adapt to new scenarios.
- **Discovering insights within large collections of data**

### What deep learning is (typically) not good for machine learning?
- **When you need explainability** - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
- **When the tradition approach is a better option** - if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
- **When errors are unacceptable** - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable.
- **When you don't have much data** - deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results. (though we can achieve great results without hugh amounts of data)

### Machine learning vs Deep learning
- **Common ML algorithms** (since the advent of deep learning these are often referred to as "**shallow algorithms**"): Random forest, Gradient boosted models, Naive Bayes, Nearest neightbour, Support vector machine, ...
- **Common DL algorithms**: Neural networks, Fully connected neural network, Convolutional neural network, Recurrent neural network, Transformer, ...
<br> Note: Depending how you represent yourproblem, many algorithms can be used for both structured and unstructured data

### Neural networks?
- Flow: <br> -> Inputs <br> -> Numerical encoding <br> -> Learns representation (patterns/features/weights) - Choose the appropriate neural network for your problem <br> -> Representation outputs <br> -> Human-understandable outputs
  <br> **Example:** A record of weather forecast (Input) -> Text converted from the record (Output)

### Different types of learning paradigms
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised & Self-supervised Learning
- Transfer Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Deep Learning Use Cases
- **Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)**: Translation, Speech recognition, ...
- **Classification/Regression**: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), ...
- **Recommendation**
